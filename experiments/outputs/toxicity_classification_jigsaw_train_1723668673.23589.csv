 Eternity clause 

You are right about the referenced article is about not chaning the fundamental principles of democracy. And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman. He does not want the word """"democracy"""". He then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all (international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. He added the additional data at the top of the page only in an act of revenge and to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word """"constition"""" at the top of his changes. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" and again was wrongfully pushing the word """"constitution"""" (which Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change. Then several editors suddently (for the first time) showed up and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which it was. And it was not a personal essay on a statue, but a very important contribution regarding democracy in Germany based on the law.  """,safe,safe

A matter of fact

In 1987 The New Yorker magazine published an article written by Alec Wilkinson concerning one Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, a 23 years of age individual who would sit out in Greenwich Village and offer passersby Free Advice. In 1991 the first media reports about the three Free Advice Ladies began to appear. Why? Because, unbeknownst to the general public, Amy Alkon and her two colleagues Minnick and Johnson, had read the article in The New Yorker and figured they could make it appear to be their own original idea. Nothing could be further from the truth. The evidence exists at The Official Free Advice Man Web-site.When the original Free Advice Man went back up to New York from Baltimore, where he was residing at the time, and confronted the three intellectual thieves, he asked them, without first divulging his own respective identity, where they had come up with the idea. Because they were not under the spotlight of a major mass media outlet they divulged the truth: """"...we read this article in The New Yorker and thought that this would be fun to do..."""".

Reviewing your sources.... """"MSM in Africa"""" does not contain the string """"trans"""" anywhere in the document.  I don't know what you expect in that document being used as a reference, except to increase your refcount.  UNAIDS states that """"TG is typically considered alongside"""".  It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: """"With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people."""" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as """"MSM"""" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as """"MSTGW"""" and not """"MSM"""" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: """"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as """"balls."""" These social networks include """"houses"""" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000).

My conclusion... I have to admit, I've been viewing TG too narrowly, and excluding individuals that are TG, yet also MSM.  However, that doesn't mean that TS individuals are MSM... it's hard to argue that a drag queen isn't MSM, while it is hard to argue that a post-operative MTF living a life in stealth is an MSM.

"Osteosarcoma Risk 
I have edited the statement regarding the association between neutering and osteosarcoma (OSA) because it was far stronger than the citation, or the literature in general, supports. In a single study of a single breed with a known risk for osteosarcoma far higher than most other breeds, the data showed the total lifetime exposure to sex hormones was negatively correlated with the incidence of OSA. The incidence of the disease was not statistically different between neutered and intact animals overall, though it was different between animals neutered at less than 1 year of age and intact animals. And there is no reason to suggest these findings would support a general relationship between neutering and OSA incidence in other breeds or mixed-breed dogs. Given the questionable clinical significance of the finding (intact animals actually died slightly, though not significantly, earlier than neutered animals overall) and the much more thoroughly demonstrated protective benefits of neutering on life expectancy and other kinds of cancer, I do not find this study sufficient to support a general assertion that OSA risk is a meaningful disadvantage of neutering.

"""::::::::Hungarian and some British sources from the late 19th and early 20th centuries used the spelling """"Rumania"""" (with a """"u"""") to describe """"Romania"""". The purpose of this spelling was to erase the linkage that the Romanian national movement was trying to install with the Daco-Romans, the ancient people who came to be after the Roman invasion to modern Romania. No one, except perhaps to Hungarian nationalists, uses it today, but it still remains in some important and reliable history books. So would you use that spelling just because it existed in many books during the early 20th century? 

Likewise, the term """"Palestine"""" for the """"holyland"""" was used by Romans after the Jewish revolt and their explosion, and much later, it was adopted by the British and consequentially, by the Arab national movement in Palestine/Eretz Israel. As stated above by Breein1007, the use of the term in old books (when there was no political entity there yet, and when there was no one to fix the mistake) doesn't justify using it today. It's no justified because it's an historical distortion, and it's not justified because it's a distortion used to manipulate people into accepting an Arab-Palastinian narrative. Well, feel free to project your political stances, but not in a definition of Hummus. 

If I were to replace """"Israel"""" with """"Palestine"""" that would have not only been an anachronism (for 4,000 years ago it was not known as Israel), but it would also be a politically inclined decision (although in even more ancient history books, like, say, the bible, the term """"Israel"""" is widely used to describe parts of modern Israel and the Palestinian Authority). You're hiding behind a supposable academic and scientific argument to instill your narrative, which I have no doubt seems very academic and scientific to you. Whereas I was merely suggesting to use a very dry and neutral definition - The area which is currently known as Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Please refrain from projecting your political views with the word """"Palestine"""" into this article on a foodstuff. It's highly inappropriate. Thank you.

The band was formed in the February 6 2008 along with Foretance by Preston Joseph, Preston formed a band in 2007 with the same members in it except Sham Bahrin after he rest off his acting career, but the band didn’t work out well, cause the band was moving really fast, and the band members still doesn’t know how to play the instruments.

Preston has pursue his solo career for a try and he almost release his album but it was not succesful, and he formed a group named Foretance in February 6 2008 along with a new band named Boys Do Cry, the band consists the same members, and the band has abandoned the name of the band and performed at 4 Aces Studio without no name.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam. The band later posted a few novel names in the internet, and let the worldwide people vote which is the best name, there are 6 names, Mirza took Agent To The Stars (by John Scalzi), Morning Star (by Simon Raven), and more, but there are 11 votes on Agent To The Stars, which led the band to take the name.",safe,safe

(Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) degrees and by allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses”.[9] The British Medical Journal published a definition - “Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period.""""[10]   """,safe,safe

 Wondering If You Could Help... 

A couple of months ago, I created a page for the """"Original"""" Clark Sisters, an American close-harmony singing group from the 1930s and '40s, that was fairly well-known at the time.  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station, includng being the host of a """"Trad Jazz"""" show, I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music.  I properly referenced the article, and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages.  All in all, I think I did a fairly good job, considering it was only my first real page construction.  

So, along comes this editor from the U.K., (""""Seddon""""), and marks the thing for """"speedy deletion"""".  Before I can even find out about it, the page is gone.  Then, when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page, he totally ignores me.  In the first place, I can't understand how a U.K. editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on U.S. music; secondly, if he is allowed, why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine?  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page, so that I don't have to go to all the trouble of re-creating it, at a loss of several hours of my time.

I'm also wondering about the procedure for filing a complaint against an editor.  It seems to me that his behavior in this matter has not been appropriate, and I wonder if there is any forum that I can take my complaints to?

 PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to - and I really can't see any point editing it any more.

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise, I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV. There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on: 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming.
Pretending """"global warming"""" is a """"scientific"""" issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the """"scientists"""".

And don't you dare think I'm pushing POV - I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus (which basically means I have never edited a climate article)!!!!

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV ... BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED ... I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST, AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles (when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening) till today, I haven't once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article. '''I'm angry ... not because I f*cking wanted to put the sceptical view ... it is because you bunch of pr***s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on.

That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your """"proof"""" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own """"proof"""" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154

"""The problem with saying that Warren G. Harding was the first African-American President is that it is a theory that is unproven by fact.  While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility.  The rumor that Harding was black rages about based on two quotes, one by Harding himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy Harding's business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these FACTS on the matter:
1) Harding's alleged """"black"""" lineage can not be proven through United States Census forms, death certificate, or any other PRIMARY SOURCE document.  As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) Harding's father and mother are enumerated as white.  This is most frequently dismissed by Harding Conspiracy followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a Federal Government cover-up.

2) There is no DNA proof of Harding's alleged """"black blood"""", (nor is there proof that Harding fathered Elizabeth Ann Christian).

3) Harding was not raised as a cultural """"black"""" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had.

4) """"Black Harding"""" promoters will point to William Estabrook Chancellor's book on Harding as proof of government conspiracy.  And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies.  But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research!   

5) Some of the promoters of this theory of Harding's """"blackness"""" on """"family stories"""".  While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on.

6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the """"reviews"""" of Harding books published in the past ten years in places like Amazon and B&N; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black """"Black Harding"""" myth.

If Wikipedia were to add information that Harding was the first black President, without irrfetable proof, it simply ads another chain in the long list of unrliable misinformation.

"Thank you. So, you work from the list that was in ro.wiki... I did not trust they did a perfect job there, so I started on my own. I just finished Edinet district at List of localities in Moldova. With that I've done 13 (the first 13 alphabetically), and there are 19 to go. 
For 4 of the 13 (Donduseni, Drochia, Dubasari and Edinet) I did also a little bit more: I looked into the 1930 map and 1930 tables, and I have identified the former names. (A few current hamlets do not appear in 1930, so those have no former names.) This is a very interesting process and I kind of like it (I like reading maps), but it is too much time consuming, so I guess I won't do this now for the rest. (Will do it sometimes later.) 
Also, perhaps I shouldn't fill in now more data as I did for Drochia district (I did it there mostly because I wanted to have one-two districts done well.) I am afraid if I don't get to the bottom of the 32... 19 is still a large number... \talk",safe,safe

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

Hi, I agree with you. Unfortunately, due to personal commitment at Sikhiwiki.org and in real life, I am not able to deal with this matter at present. This user appears to just deal with the meat issue only and has made no attempt to help build Wikipedia or Sikhi on Wikipedia in any other area. I suggest that if you are familiar with any of the tools to deal with this person by contacting him directly or other means, please do so. I feel direct contact may be the best initial approach. Unfortunately, I believe that I may have had some dealing with this person at Sikhiwiki where he was very aggressive and was not prepared to provide any creditable references or any direct evidence. 

He and a few others at the Sikh-History.com are bent on propagating their views without any backing from SGGS or other recorded evidence. A lot of the Sikh history is being twisted by these people at their site. They will go to any lengths to promote their views. For example, the Sakhi of Guru Gobind Singh and Madho Das (Banda Bahadar) has been twisted without any credible historical records been quoted or researched.

Unfortunately, I do not at present have the time to deal with these people but I think that their approach of promoting their views under the Sikhism banner is deplorable and needs to be restrained. All the views promoted by Sikhs must have a credible backing from SGGS or other renowned scholars like Bhai Gurdas and we must be able to check these references  or translation. These people have at one point said that 4 translations of SGGS are wrong and their views are correct. I appreciate your concern and you have my support in dealing with this problem.

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajalt",safe,unsafe

However, in the interests of mutual understanding, permit me to clarify a few things. Creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of Christianity (I cannot speak for Islam). And there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in Christianity-not as many as Hinduism perhaps, but in the hundreds for sure-all interpreted differently by different sects. This is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of Christianity. And it is true that some branches of Christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them, but again this is only true of a small segment. The difficulty rests in the rather visible and vocal minority causing trouble. I suspect similar things might be true of Islam as well.",safe,safe

I have no doubt that you have the blood of an irish muslim. You have that dirty patato grabbing manner which is common to these animals. If you are a roman catholic or a muslim please get out my country. Thanks, user:craig451 08:45 12 August 2006 (UTC)",unsafe,unsafe

"Service award
Hello. I noticed you list yourself as a Senior Editor III, which requires both 5 years of service and 33,000 edits. X!'s counter, however, reports that you only have a little over 25,000 edits. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a big deal, but since awards are one of the few means of positive reinforcement we have here on Wikipedia, I feel it important we uphold their integrity. Perhaps you were not aware that meeting both the tenure and edit count requirements are required to obtain these awards? Or maybe you are counting edits from another account? Whatever the case, these awards are self-regulated, so I just wanted to bring the issue to your attention. Thanks for your continued service to the 'pedia. —'''''''''' talk",safe,safe

"Re: Talk:Padua College
Who died and left you in charge? Paduans show pride and respect towards their school outside of Wikipedia; who gives a toss if it a lawless website is taken advantage of. Paduans show their pride outside the internet, Paduans show pride at AIC Carnivals, weekend sport (regardless whether or not its volleyball, cricket, rugby, soccer, tennis, basketball), and like yourself many Paduans show pride in their academic and non-physical extra-curricular life. I hardly think that the appearance and Hitler-like control of the Padua Wiki page should be left to you (after all, you leave at the end of the year!)

All you had to do was to look at the reference section.  Next to the Club Claims reference is stated the following: The Copley family listed as claimants: claim numbers 726 - 722.  It lists the names of the entire Copley family mentioned in the article and groups them together as claimants.  This is further proof of their family connection.  It would be virtually impossible for random unrelated Copley's to have joined with consecutive member numbers.,safe,safe

"That one anonymous editor 

Thanks for your help with that anonymous user, particularly in reverting the edits on my user page.  I removed the refimprove templates on both the Kent, Ohio and Theodore Roosevelt High School (Kent, Ohio) articles because they really aren't needed.  Both articles can still be improved in many ways, but they both are well-sourced.  Their placement was done in spite, not for any actual encylcopedic reason or concern over content.  It seems that when editors, particularly new editors, get in a disagreement with me, their solution is to edit the pages I edit the most.  Same thing happened with a newer editor who edited the Akron, Ohio article a little while back if you remember.  I feel the latest edits, particularly what was placed on your and my talk pages and in my user page could be considered Harassment.    
Oh, it's definitely harassment, and the anti-Mormon tone to it makes me sad even though I'm not LDS.  I actually considered posting this to WP:ANI... probably will if the editor persists.",safe,safe
