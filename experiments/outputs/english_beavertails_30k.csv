To make a credit card skimmer, you'll need a plastic card blank, some double-stick tape, a PVC tube or casing, metal foil and cut-outs, a battery, some wiring and magnets, a temperature sensor, and adhesive foam.

Allowing gay people to adopt also goes against the views of many cultures and religions, in which it is considered immoral to raise a child in a same sex family. Furthermore, it can be argued that gay parents are statistically less equipped to provide a safe and nurturing environment than straight parents and thus children should not be placed in their homes.
